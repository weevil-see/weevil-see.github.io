Hi! I’m Jakob (he/him), an entomologist and master's student with a focus on weevils and biodiversity.

  <em> In this work, one should always consider oneself a student who can in a lifetime learn comparatively little of what there is to be learned.</em> - E.C. Zimmerman, Australian Weevils Vol. VI

## Why do I run a blog?
We live in strange times: The technological possibilities for entomologists have never been greater. Public appreciation for insects may be at an all-time high. And yet, the number of experts—those who can accurately identify insects and deeply understand their behavior through direct observation—appears to be dwindling.

Of course the number of potential readers for this blog is small. But if I can spark enthusiasm or offer advice to just one person on their journey to becoming an entomologist, then my effort is worth it!
I started communicating about weevils on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/weevil.see/), but I felt very limited in how I could express myself (unfortunately I like long texts).
