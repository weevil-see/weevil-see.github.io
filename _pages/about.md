Hi! I’m Jakob (he/him), an entomologist and master's student with a focus on weevils and biodiversity.

My former social media handle "*@curculio.noidea*" was a nod to the labyrinthine complexity of weevil taxonomy, expressing that I have "no idea" about the Curculionoidea.

There's a lot to learn, discover and to marvel at.<br>
Weevil see where this journey is going!

## Why do I run a blog?
We live in strange times: The technological possibilities for entomologists have never been greater. Public appreciation for insects may be at an all-time high. And yet, the number of experts—those who can accurately identify insects and deeply understand their behavior through direct observation—appears to be dwindling.

Of course the number of potential readers for this blog is small. But if I can spark enthusiasm or offer advice to just one person on their journey to becoming an entomologist, then my effort is worth it!
I started communicating about weevils on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/weevil.see/), but I felt very limited in how I could express myself (unfortunately I like long texts).
