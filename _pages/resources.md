This page is listing the most basic sources of information on weevils all around the world. It is meant to get you started if you're struggling to get an overview.

## Worldwide
There is no up to date worldwide checklist for all weevil species. The most recent attempt to list every weevil species of the world was the "Coleopterorum Catalogus auspiciis et auxilio", which at the same time was the last attempt to catalogue every beetle species. If you don't find a more recent source, this is your fallback.
### Checklists
#### Coleopterorum Catalogus
The "*Coleopterorum Catalogus auspiciis et auxilio*" was published in 170 parts, which where later arranged in 31 volumes, from 1910 to 1940.\
A collection of (hopefully) every part of the Coleopterorum Catalogus dealing with weevils (excluding Scolytinae and Platypodinae) can be found [here](https://github.com/weevil-see/files.weevil-see.github.io/tree/main/Coleopterorum_Catalogus_Curculionoidea).

The monumental piece of work is still relevant for several reasons:
- For many regions and taxonomic groups, it remains the most recent comprehensive checklist available.
- Many entomological collections with historical roots are still organized according to the Catalogus. As its taxonomy is now highly outdated and differs from modern classifications, the Catalogus is often the only tool for locating specimens in museums.
- It is a key historical document. Understanding the historical classification of weevils is essential for interpreting older entomological literature. The Catalogus also served as the foundation for many later works and can be used to trace the origins of information (including errors).

    caption="Exemplary entries from the **Coleopterorum Catalogus**:<br>
    Valid species are printed in **bold**. The first citation following each name is the original description; subsequent citations refer to additional taxonomic literature. Synonymous names are given in *italics*, but for the variations (var.) I'm not exactly sure if they where also considered synonymous. Occasionally, references concerning biology or other topics are included under the corresponding headings (here 'Biologie', German for 'biology'). Distributional data is found on the right, written in German."

Wilhelm Junk, the publisher of the original *Coleopterorum Catalogus auspiciis et auxilio*, was Jewish. After fleeing Nazi Germany to the Netherlands, he and his wife tragically took their own lives in December 1942, just before the Gestapo arrived to arrest and deport them. Another series named "*Coleopterorum Catalogus Supplementa*" was started to keep the Catalogus updated, but it eventually ceased to be published.\
Nowadays, we tend to rely on online databases such as *Catalogue of Life* or *GBIF*. I noticed they do not meet the necessary standards for entomological work, as they are either incomplete or contain too many errors, which stem from automated data aggretation. For taxonomic work, it's important to stick to sources which where carefully compiled by experts.
