## About
This repository hosts the source code and content for [my personal blog](https://weevil-see.github.io/), where I write about topics including programming, technology, and personal projects.

The blog is built using GitHub Pages and powered by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. All content is written and maintained by me, and the site is regularly updated with new posts and improvements.

Feel free to explore the code, suggest changes, or reach out if you have any questions or feedback.

Notes:
Site performance might be impacted by the setting
search_full_content      : true
in _config.yml
